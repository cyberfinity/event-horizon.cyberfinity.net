  <p>It's quite amazing what sort of stuff ends up inside a black hole!</p>
  <p>
    Once upon a time there were a few sites that my friends and I had made. For
    one reason or other they are no longer online. Whatever relics of theirs
    still exist are buried somewhere deep in Event-Horizon. Perhaps one day they
    will be uncovered and restored back to their original glory....
  </p>
  <p>
    The following are ex-locations that no longer exist either because the URL
    and/or webspace no longer exists or because the websites have been removed.
    The addresses are listed here in the hope that search-engines will pick up
    on them and refer anyone searching for them to this page!
