  <p>
    Event-Horizon is a little personal web-server that belongs to
    <a href="https://cirrus.twiddles.com/">James Nash</a> and is being used for the
    following purposes:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      To host <a href="sites.htm">various websites</a> (such as this one)
    </li>
    <li>
      To enable remote logins / file transfers via SSH, so James can check up on
      Event-Horizon while he's out.
    </li>
    <li>And just to generally experiment with server admin! :)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    James built Event-Horizon himself. This was done to avoid paying for stuff
    he didn't need that would otherwise get bundled with an average PC: Fancy
    graphics and sound cards, Dial-up modem and, of course, lousy Microsoft
    software. ;-)
  </p>
  <p>
    Anyway, moving swiftly on - here's the spec for the geeks out there who
    care:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Athlon XP 1600 CPU (runs at 1.4GHz)</li>
    <li>512MB 333MHz DDR RAM</li>
    <li>2 x 60GB 7200rpm harddrives</li>
    <li>2 x 10/100Mbit Ethernet cards</li>
    <li class="eve-margin-block-start">OS: Debian Linux</li>
  </ul>
