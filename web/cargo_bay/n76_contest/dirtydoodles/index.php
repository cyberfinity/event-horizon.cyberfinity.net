			<h2>About Dirty Doodles</h2>
				<p>The <strong>Dirty Doodles</strong> design was submitted on 20. June 2007 but unfortunately it did not become available on the competition website for voting until 11. August 2007, the very last day of the competition. It ended up on position 10197.</p>
				<p>The design itself is inspired by the random doodles people tend to draw while speaking on the phone. The whole phone is covered in intricate white doodles on a orange gradient background. The doodles follow the shape of the device and contain several gags and interesting details.</p>
