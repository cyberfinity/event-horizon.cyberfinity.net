			<h2>About Midnight Doodles</h2>
			<p>The <strong>Midnight Doodles</strong> design was submitted on 8. July 2007 but sadly it did not get approved before the end of the contest. It has however appeared on the competition website since (on 24. August 2007) and can therefore be viewed in all its glory.</p>
			<p>The design is essentially a black &amp; white variant of <a href="../dirtydoodles/">Dirty Doodles</a>. It retains the same, white scribblings across the device but replaces the orange background with a dithered, charcoal grey one.</p>
