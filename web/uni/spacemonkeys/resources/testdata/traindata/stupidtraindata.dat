Once upon a time in a far away land there was a big friendly giant.
Friendly to other giants that is, not humans. No if he met a human they
would be down his throat faster than a missile. But, nonetheless, he was
very friendly, and polite, in an eating humans kind of way. 
And he lived happily ever after!
