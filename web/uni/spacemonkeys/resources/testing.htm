The following document will outline all relevant test procedures that will be incorporated in the programming of this system.  It will give
a description of what parts of the system will be tested, how they will be tested including methods and procedures, and actual test data 
(some of this will be alluded to rather than printed out, as it can all be accessed via the website, and makes for more concise reading).
Each of the tests that we carry out will be documented and numbered, so that they can be referred to easily in the test results.  Each test
will consist of information regarding how it will be carried out, pre and post conditions and at what stage in the project it is to be 
executed.  The various tests will be divided into different categories depending on at what level they are to be carried out.  Various
levels of testing will include:
<p>

<b>- High level testing:</b> Includes tests regarding usability of the GUI. For example, how easy is it to navigate the site, can a user do all 
the things he/she want to do, does the user only have access to the parts of the system they should do and so on.  Most of these tests will
be done when the system is complete, or very near completion.<p>
<b>- Class testing:</b> These will be done during coding for the most part, probably on completion of a particular class.  Does the class produce
the correct data when it is passed the correct parameters.  How do the classes interact with each other, do they communicate in the way 
that they have been designed to?<p>
<b>- General code testing:</b> An on-going test procedure carried out while coding, including methods such as System.out.println statements.  
This part of the testing will not be documented in the same way as the above tests for obvious reasons, but is being mentioned as part of 
this document as it will make up a large percentage of how we will get
the system to run in the correct way.<p>
<b>- Algorithm testing:</b>  Parts of the coding that are more complex will require detailed algorithm design and analysis and where possible, 
dry runs and test rigs will be constructed to ensure correct functionality before they are hardcoded.  Again, these cannot be documented
here as we need to start coding before these become aparant to us, but is being mentioned as it will be neccessary as part of the testing.
<p>
The first section of tests will refer to the usability of the system, i.e. how the user will interact with the system including expected output.

These are the only tests which have been fully documented as they are the only ones at this stage that can be.  They all relate to the use cases for the individual users and reflect all the different things that these users will be able to do.  The test data that has been included at this stage is going to be used in the class testing, but more details of the class testing will be available once the full UML procedure is complete.
