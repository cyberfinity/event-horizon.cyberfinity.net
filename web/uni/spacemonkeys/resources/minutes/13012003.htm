   Please correct the title of the page above (the bit between <title> and </title>)

   First off you just need to change the text below - shouldn't need to touch

<!--

   Ok, this is just a list of links to the minutes of the agenda points further down.
   You may want to type out the minutes first and then come back to this!

   Basically there needs to be one link for each agenda point. Copy-paste / remove
   some of the 3 example links below if you have more / less agenda points.
   Rename the 'Point 1' bits to the names of the actual agenda points and change the
   links (the <a href="#<some link>"> bits) so that they match the anchor names you
   specified below...   

//-->

<ul>
<li><a href="#p1">Last meeting's minutes</a></li>
<li><a href="#p2">Focus on Part A</a></li>
<li><a href="#p3">Other Business</a></li>
</ul>





<hr>
<h1><a name="minutes"><img src="minutes.png" width="133" height="26" alt="Minutes"></a></h1>
<!--

   This is where you type out the actual agenda points!
   Each one should be in a blue box so the text needs to be surrounded by DIV tags
   (See the examples below).

//-->


<div class="box">
<!--

   OK, that was the opening DIV tag to create a box. Everything that follows up until the
   closing DIV tag is inside the box.

   Next up is the heading. Change this from 'Point 1' to something sensible. You should
   use the same heading here that you use above in the agenda points links!

   Then you need to give the heading an anchor name. This is the name that links above refer to
   so webrowsers know whereabouts on the page they should scroll to when a link is clicked.
   The anchor name is in defined in the <a name="<name here>"> bit. You may wish to just leave
   them as p1, p2, ... pn for the sake of simplicty.

//-->
<u><a name="p1">Last meeting's minutes</a></u>
<p>
<!--

   Right, the heading's done. Now you can just type your text in...
   Please don't use any HTML tags within your text other than <a> for links and
   <p> to create a space between paragraphs.
   In time I'll probably add stuff to the style sheet to make adding images uniform too
   but I can't really see it being used in minutes much!
   
//-->
Review the last meeting's minutes in order to clarify any outstanding issues or concerns.  Two concerns were raised regarding the fact that we still didn't have a full specification for the project and we were lacking an algorithm to draw a map of the network accurately. Both were to be resolved as soon as possible, preferably before the next meeting.


<!--

   And finally the closing DIV tag to end the box! Make sure u don't have a <p> tag before this
   unless you want a stupidly large gap between the bottom of the text and the bottom of the box!

//-->
</div>


<!--

    That was one box now we need a P tag to create a blank space and then we can
    begin with the next box!
    
    Don't forget to add these if you add more boxes!

//-->

<div class="box">
<u><a name="p2">Focus on Part A</a></u>
<p>
Members present came up with a list of documents that would need to be produced for Part A of the assignment.  These included
	1.)Project Plan: this document was needed to coordinate and complete various sections of the assignment to a deadline other that the one given by the DCS.  The aim was to distribute the work in an efficient manner and have the sections completed before the deadline of Friday 31st January in order to give members of the group sufficient time to prepare all the documents for handing in.
<p>
	2.)High Level Analysis: this document is a requirement of Part A and is to be discussed and completed by all members of the group.
<p>
	3.)Requirements Analysis: this document is to discussed and completed by the whole group in a manner that facilitates easy transference to UML notation.  The requirements are to be sketched on paper before hand and then transfered to UML by one person.
<p>
	4.)Test Cases: this document signifies the available test methods that can be used to test the software program.  To be completed by at least one member of the group.

<p>
It was noted that now a project plan had been drawn up, regular meeting would need to take place in order to make sure that sections of the project were being completed on time.  If possible these meetings should take place at least twice a week.

<!--

   That's the end of the boxes!
   Remember to take care of the agenda points section above (just before the boxes
   started) if you didn't do that before!


   Other than that you're finished!
   See, HTML ain't that difficult after all! :)

   Save the file using the meeting's date as the filename (like 27112002.htm for the meeting
   on 27.11.2002). Then please add a link to your new minutes in the index.html file in this
   directory (there is a comment in the file to tell you where!).

   Now you're done! Cheers!
