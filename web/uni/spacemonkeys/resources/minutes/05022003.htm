   First off you just need to change the text below - shouldn't need to touch
   any of the HTML tags. Don't forget to change meeting number in the heading!

   When you're done carry on to the next comment!

<!--

   Ok, this is just a list of links to the minutes of the agenda points further down.
   You may want to type out the minutes first and then come back to this!

   Basically there needs to be one link for each agenda point. Copy-paste / remove
   some of the 3 example links below if you have more / less agenda points.
   Rename the 'Point 1' bits to the names of the actual agenda points and change the
   links (the <a href="#<some link>"> bits) so that they match the anchor names you
   specified below...

//-->

<ul>
<li><a href="#p1">Clarification of what needs to be done</a></li>
<li><a href="#p2">Allocation of tasks</a></li>
<li><a href="#p3">Setting deadlines</a></li>
</ul>





<hr>
<h1><a name="minutes"><img src="minutes.png" width="133" height="26" alt="Minutes"></a></h1>
<!--

   This is where you type out the actual agenda points!
   Each one should be in a blue box so the text needs to be surrounded by DIV tags
   (See the examples below).

//-->


<div class="box">
<!--

   OK, that was the opening DIV tag to create a box. Everything that follows up until the
   closing DIV tag is inside the box.

   Next up is the heading. Change this from 'Point 1' to something sensible. You should
   use the same heading here that you use above in the agenda points links!

   Then you need to give the heading an anchor name. This is the name that links above refer to
   so webrowsers know whereabouts on the page they should scroll to when a link is clicked.
   The anchor name is in defined in the <a name="<name here>"> bit. You may wish to just leave
   them as p1, p2, ... pn for the sake of simplicty.

<u><a name="p1">Clarification of what needs to be done</a></u>
<p>
Now that part A of the assignment had been handed it was necessary to review the requirements for part B so that we could begin
planning who would do what and when. It was noted that the tasks for part B lended themsleves better to being split among
members of the group, unlike part A where some things required all members to work on the same thing.<br>
3 main areas of work were identified:<ol>
<li>Java Programming</li>
<li>UML documentation</li>
<li>Misc. documents (eg: Management Report)</li>
</ol>
<br>
Most of the work would be in parts 1 & 2 so we decided to make them top priority for the time being.
<p>
It was also decided that a new timetable should be drawn up once the tasks had been allocated to the SpaceMonkeys.
</div>


<!--

    That was one box now we need a P tag to create a blank space and then we can
    begin with the next box!

    Don't forget to add these if you add more boxes!

//-->
<p>



<div class="box">
<u><a name="p2">Allocation of tasks</a></u>
<p>
Ben and Gideon were the least confident with their programming abilities and most interested in the UML design, so they were
an easy choice for section 1. No one had any objections, so Ben and Gideon were pronounced official SpaceMonkey UML Gurus!<p>
That left the rest for programming. It was decided that the classes that make up our system could be divided into two groups: the internal classes that perform queries and the GUI classes that provide the user interface.
<br>
Both Mike and Tom had an interest in Discrete Maths (which it was decided would be useful when implementing the Network class) and they volunteered
to take care of the internal classes. Again there were no objections so Mike and Tom became the SpaceMonkey internal Java Class Ninjas.
<br>
That left Alex and James to do the GUI side. Fortunately both are interested in user interfaces and so they happily accepted the position of
SpaceMonkey GUI Overlords!

</div>

<p>

<div class="box">
<u><a name="p3">Setting Deadlines</a></u>
<p>
Next the order in which tasks should be done were decided. It was decided the UML should come first since it is intended
as a blueprint for our system. However it was a agreed upon that some of the smaller and simpler Java classes could be coded almost
right away since all information needed to make them was covered in our Part A UML documents.<br>
We decided that once the necessary UML diagrams were ready, the internal and GUI classes could be started on at more or less the same time.
Until that point in time it was decided that Mike, Tom, Alex and James should make themselves familiar with the relevant Java
knowledge to make their classes. It was also decided that some time should be allocated to testing the system once it is complete.
<br>
James was assigned the task of creating a new timetable for the coming weeks to illustrate during what time periods the tasks were to be done and when they should be completed.

<!--

   That's the end of the boxes!
   Remember to take care of the agenda points section above (just before the boxes
   started) if you didn't do that before!


   Other than that you're finished!
   See, HTML ain't that difficult after all! :)

   Save the file using the meeting's date as the filename (like 27112002.htm for the meeting
   on 27.11.2002). Then please add a link to your new minutes in the index.html file in this
   directory (there is a comment in the file to tell you where!).

   Now you're done! Cheers!
