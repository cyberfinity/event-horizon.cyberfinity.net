<u>ArgoUML issues</u>
<p>
We decided to use ArgoUML to create our UML diagrams since it was free and cross-platform, meaning all team members could use it. Unfortunately it turns out that ArgoUML
won't let you
specify arrays of things as a type of an attribute or operation in a class diagram (and yes, we did RTFM, but that part hadn't been written yet!). Therefore some of the types
shown in our UML diagrams are not quite correct. We have
included the correct types in the notes on the diagram wherever necessary.
<p>
Please excuse this slightly messy work-around!
<p>
<u>Before you read on...</u>
<p>
...you should know that most documents in this report were printed straight from our website because we decided to use HTML for our documents (see 1st meeting's minutes). Due
to the large-ish font and big borders there is less text on each page than if we had used a traditional word-processor. Therefore our report seems to exceed the 20-page
limit but we think you'll find that the actual content is just the right amount! :)
