1049801790¬¬cirrus¬¬The site has now been completed as best as possible. The internal resources are now also open to the general public!<p> Enjoy!
1049049609¬¬cirrus¬¬Hope everyone's enjoying their holidays! <p> Now that the project is over I will clean up a few pages (mostly behind-the-scenes kinda stuff) and open up the site to the public. Perhaps other CS students will find it interesting...
1047589302¬¬btm¬¬more for myself than anyone else, but someone may find it useful... <br><a href="screenshots/">screenshots</a>
1047328561¬¬cirrus¬¬FileIO is finally finished and working!!! Wooooohooooooo!! <p> Respect due to Potnudl for sorting it out!
1047220312¬¬btm¬¬Hey james/alex, i'm doing the use manual at the moment, and would appreciate a few screenshots of each view, if you've got that far with the GUI?  This includes the screen you would encounter the first time you open the programme too, cheers. <p> PS a bit of feedback on those diagrams would be useful, i'm going to do a general program one too
1047135579¬¬btm¬¬ok heres the <a href="resources/umlpart2/">activity diagrams</a>, inform me if they don't tally with the programme and i'll change them. <br>I've also started the user manual, but haven't got far enough to put anything online.
1047131777¬¬potnoodle¬¬Hey James, this java is doing my nut in, in the filIO class, it doesnt recognise methods like exists() when it blatantly should... Same with the gui, im trying out a coupla things, like drop down box, border around whole box, and making the window he same size as the users screen res, but it also does not recognise some obviousl methods. eg. setBounds(), but still recognises others in the JFrame class.... :'(
1047058681¬¬cirrus¬¬Added and tested createStationPlan() method to HtmlOutputter.
1047044459¬¬cirrus¬¬I made a small class called TestFile to test the File class once it actually gets finished.<p> Since java.io contains a class called File (which we may even use inside our one) I guess it might be a good idea to change the name like Alex suggested. How does "FileIO" sound?<p> If you change the name of File you will need to edit lines 17 & 27 of TestFile.java to reflect this, in order for it to work.
1047043481¬¬cirrus¬¬Just a reminder: Please use this news section to mention any work you have done! When you have finished a big class or a big part of one post a message so everyone else can see what u did!<br> The same goes for you Ben and Gideon - please let us know about any UML progress you make!<p> Cheers!
1046909369¬¬cirrus¬¬k, well if u need to rename File just make sure it's uppercase!! <p> As for FTP... well one day when I have time perhaps. For now you'll just have to find a way to SSH in. Microsoft's flawless operating system Windows can surely do that, right? :P
1046896350¬¬potnoodle¬¬I tink sorted most of the File.java file, btw, 'File' is a class you need within the class you idiots!! So ive renamed it fileIO..., canny get this thing online tho, will James put FTP on event-horizon? Eessh James youre so useless!! :P
1046720850¬¬cirrus¬¬Alex and I have started programming the GUI today. So far we have produced the main "Spacemonkeys' Amazing Train System" (SATS) window. Inside that there are tabs for the different views. We have also begun with the actual Passenger view GUI and Password prompts for Station Master and Network Operator views. <p> <a href="sats_shot1.png"><img src="sats_shot1_thmb.png" width="80" height="56" alt="SATS screenshot"></a>
1046668878¬¬cirrus¬¬Right, finally made a page about Java style guidelines we should all use  for this project. Please go and read this since it's real important!!<p> I'm (finally) off to bed now!
1046662960¬¬cirrus¬¬I have cleaned up the resources section a little and have added a link under 'Admin' that lets you generate javadoc documentation for your sourcecode! <p> Currently it tries to document all .java files available. If any contain errors (like they do at the moment) it won't create any documents. If I have spare time (unlikely) I might add some functionality so you can choose which files it runs on. For now you'll just have to write perfect code! ^_^ 
1045514104¬¬cirrus¬¬Ok, I've started coding a few of the simple classes for our project!<p> The code is on event-horizon (you need to ssh in to see it) and the documentation is available in the resources section of this site!<p> enjoy!
1043938084¬¬cirrus¬¬Gideon's minutes of the 3rd meeting are now online!
1043809149¬¬cirrus¬¬Finally our work is starting to take shape! <p> Today (well mostly yesterday, technically) we transferred some of our UML diagrams to ArgoUML and output them as PostScript, ready for printing. <p> We have also produced test-case documentation and test data. <p> The fruits of our work are all available in the resources section right now! Enjoy!
1043783954¬¬btm¬¬Ok, very basic documentation of testing done lets try a link, <a href="resources/testing.htm">Hope this works!</a>
1043628971¬¬btm¬¬I've put a few test data files on event horizon and the 'alex' movie. <br>I'm sure you'll be able to find them, i've created directories in the home directory.
1042749351¬¬cirrus¬¬<a href="resources/project_plan.htm">Project Plan</a> and <a href="resources/graphs.htm">Ben's graph drawing algorithm</a> are now online! <p> Don't forget to learn UML tonight! ;P
1042628040¬¬potnoodle¬¬Pssh, laptops, all they do is break!! 
1042627997¬¬cirrus¬¬The SpaceMonkeys are back in force this term!<p> Already had one meeting and one session! The next session is scheduled for this Thursday - we're finally gonna do some UML!!<p> Laptops here we come!! Raaarrr!
1041723678¬¬cirrus¬¬The minutes of the first meeting are finally online! Yay!
1040380660¬¬cirrus¬¬Well, looks like we're all home now! I know it's hard to do during holidays (especially during xmas), but please please remember to do some work for the project!<p> Well done to Ben for getting that algorithm for drawing the graph! I got myself a Java book yesterday that covers GUIs so hopefully I'll be able to give that a try sometime soon.<p> As for the rest of yez... done anything yet? Come on! We're gonna get those laptops!! :)
1039458646¬¬cirrus¬¬Now now, children! Behave! <p> Nothing major - I've just fixed a minor bug in the news displaying script. It's all good now! :)
1039360826¬¬btm¬¬No probs, it'll go nicely with my christmas dinner, yum yum. <br>Anyone who slept in O31 Rootes Residence last year should be ignored. All others should have a great christmas! <p>PS Delete any of that "mans" (loosest terms, noodle IS more accurate) messages please cirrus.
1039358691¬¬potnoodle¬¬Yeah you too you splog. Why dont you go eat your head. Merry Xmas everyone but the abusive Ben. Oh yeah, my second laptop is a dud, eesh can someone kill me!
1039203188¬¬btm¬¬Alex is a northern troll! <br>Do the minutes bullhead! <p>Have a good christmas too. <br>
1039143702¬¬cirrus¬¬I've made a new news system! You can now easily add news items from the comfort of your own browser now!!<p> Just go to <a href="http://event-horizon.kicks-ass.net/uni/spacemonkeys/resources/news_add.pl">this page</a> and try it out!
1038884205¬¬cirrus¬¬Had our second meeting today! Now we've actually got some idea of what we wanna be doing! The minutes are available here now!<p>Also, some of our site is now restricted access. So only true SpaceMonkeys can view minutes and other sensitive documents! Sorry y'all!
1038452275¬¬cirrus¬¬The SpaceMonkeys are online! Our site is hereby open!<p>The site is being hosted on James's 'puter <a href="http://event-horizon.kicks-ass.net/">Event-Horizon</a>. All SpaceMonkeys will also get user accounts on Event-Horizon so they can log in via SSH anytime and use it as a central file store! 
1038365894¬¬cirrus¬¬We had our first meeting today. Minutes should be available soon!
