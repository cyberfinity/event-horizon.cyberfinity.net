Nintendo Tournaments
</div>
<p>
Who says video games are just for little kids?!? Here at O2 we take our gaming very seriously! We currently have a SNES (which is mine and therefore the best console that ever graced this earth!) and Film Alex's N64. Andrew has contributed a bunch of extra SNES games so we have a sizeable collection to keep us entertained when we get back from Top B wasted or should be doing revision! Muscle Alex and myself also have GBAs as a back-up in case of lectures or seminars. I will also definitely get a GameCube sometime soon!</p>
<p>
NINTENDO RULEZ 4 EVER!!!!!   XBOX SUCKS ARSE!!!
</p>
It looks like we will have an ISS tournament on the N64 soon (we already have personalised player characters for each O2 inhabitant!) and hopefully we will have the long awaited SNES tournament soon-ish too! Here's the <a href=snes.htm>old page</a> with details of the SNES tournament planned for 2001 that never happened :(
