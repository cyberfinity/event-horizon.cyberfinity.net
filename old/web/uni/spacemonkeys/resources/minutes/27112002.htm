   Ok, this is just a list of links to the minutes of the agenda points further down.
   You may want to type out the minutes first and then come back to this!

   Basically there needs to be one link for each agenda point. Copy-paste / remove
   some of the 3 example links below if you have more / less agenda points.
   Rename the 'Point 1' bits to the names of the actual agenda points and change the
   links (the <a href="#<some link>"> bits) so that they match the anchor names you
   specified below...

<div class="box">
<u><a name="p1">Format for documentation</a></u>
<p>
We discussed possible formats for the documentation for the project; the group agree upon the use of HTML as the format, as it is obviously accessible through event-horizon, is easy to implement, accessible and we can provide links for possible references.
</div>

<p>


<div class="box">
<u><a name="p2">Basic Aims over the next few weeks</a></u>
<p>
The group agreed the neccessity for the whole group to be up to date on the UML covered in the lectures so far, by the end of the holiday period. The group discussed the possibility of assignments of ?speciality? research - we can be divided into three groups to each have th goal of learning and achieving guru status in obviously UML(advanced and beyond the scope of the course), HTML for documentation and other, Java(API/Swing) for the graphical user interface of the timetabling system and Java OOP advanced and algorithms, for the core programming of the project. A complete familiarity with the specification is a bare essential for everyone going away this christmas.

<p>

<div class="box">
<u><a name="p3">Rough ideas for the program</a></u>
<p>
<ul>
<li>A GUI is obviously necessary for any user friendly interaction</li>
<li>An idea to revise the current ?deadlines? to around 2 weeks forward - to allow ample time for sharpening up and ample testing time</li>
<li>We must make up a proper project plan, by exact date for dealines for each member of the group</li>
<li>One of two of the group may look into the lectured UML utilities is great detail</li>
<li>The usage of javadoc may be helpful; it is HTML based and makes it easier by producing docs from the code</li>
</ul>
</div>


<p>


<div class="box">
<u><a name="p4">The Views</a></u>
<p>
There was discussion over the actual ueser interface, whether a login prompt may be a good idea, or even the possibility of a password prompt for certain areas of the program. The actual "passenger view" may be always displayed, no matter which level of access login. This is clearly seen in many other already professionally implemented ideas, such as the national rail and coach service websites, where no login gives normal restricted access to the basic website, and a higher level login gives access to other administrative parts of the website. A real-time view will not always be needed - a simple query is needed for most purposes. There may be a common config file with get and set methods.
<p>
<ul>
<li>The passenger view - Many ideas were discussed; the inclusion of pull down lists, the options. Whether each separate view would be its own java program, all referring to a central database and config file. The passenger view should be viewable to all three views by default.</li>
<li>The network operator view - There was discussion over the view which the net-op should have; a graphic interface with visual representations of the nodes, tracks and trains is necessary. We will assume constant speed for visual representation of the train journeys. There could be reference to the system
clock for use with the graph.</li>
</ul>
