In the deep, deep dark, in the deep, deep cave, in the deep, deep
forest, in the deep, deep country, on the deep, deep planet thousands of
years ago in the deep, deep galaxy far, far away.
There was a spider. Not a very big spider, only as big as, oh I don't
know maybe a fingernail of an average size 25 year old women. Big enough
for the same women to scream at even tho it couldn't hurt a fly.
(Metaphorically speaking, spiders do actually generally hurt flies)
Anyway the point is that this spider lived a long and relatively (for a
spider) happy life. The end.
